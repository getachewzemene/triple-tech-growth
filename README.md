# Welcome to Triple Technologies

## Project info

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Security Notice
**No system can fully prevent determined screen recording attempts.** This platform implements defense-in-depth strategies to deter casual piracy and provide forensic evidence:

- **Physical cameras** can always record screens
- **OS-level screen recorders** may bypass browser protections
- **Hardware capture cards** can intercept video signals


- ‚úÖ **Strong deterrence** against casual downloading/sharing
- ‚úÖ **Native app protections** for mobile platforms


### Core Security Features
- **Short-lived playback tokens** (90 seconds) with JWT validation
- **Dynamic visible watermarks** with TripleAcademy branding + user info
- **CloudFront signed URLs** with 5-minute expiry
- **User agent binding** and IP tracking
- **Rate limiting** on token requests

### Video Platform Features

- **Admin course upload** with drag & drop, pause/resume
- **Encrypted HLS** fallback (AES-128)
- **Multipart upload** for large files with resume capability

### Enterprise Features (Optional)

- **Widevine/PlayReady/FairPlay DRM** integration
- **Hardware-level video protection**
- **Advanced forensic watermarking**
- **Professional transcoding pipelines**

## üìã Prerequisites
