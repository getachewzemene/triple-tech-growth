# TripleAcademy Secure Video Platform

A production-ready, secure video course platform built with Next.js, featuring DRM-like protection, forensic watermarking, and defense-in-depth security measures.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Security Notice

**No system can fully prevent determined screen recording attempts.** This platform implements defense-in-depth strategies to deter casual piracy and provide forensic evidence:

- **Physical cameras** can always record screens
- **OS-level screen recorders** may bypass browser protections  
- **Hardware capture cards** can intercept video signals
- **Rooted/jailbroken devices** may circumvent app-level protections

This platform provides:
- ‚úÖ **Strong deterrence** against casual downloading/sharing
- ‚úÖ **Forensic watermarking** for leak tracing and legal enforcement
- ‚úÖ **Access control** and session management
- ‚úÖ **Enterprise DRM integration** (optional)
- ‚úÖ **Native app protections** for mobile platforms
